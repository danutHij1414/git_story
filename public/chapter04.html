    <p>
        At the end of the week I usually have to option of either going out with friends or staying home and doing assignments or study. In the
        past I'd choose to go out all the time but lately since the college work has been increasing in difficulty and quantity of work I have
        to do, I now choose to stay in and do college work instead of leaving it last minute.(the same as chapter 3, paragraph 1)

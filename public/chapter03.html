    <h1>A Day in the Life: Part 3</h1>

    <p>
        At the end of the week I usually have th option of either going out with friends or stayinbg home and doing assignments or study. In the
        past i'd choose to go out all the time but lately since the college work has been increasing in difficulty and quantity of work I hhave
        to do, I now choose to stay in and do college work instead of leaving it last minute.
    </p>

    <p>
        The work i uually do is the work i refuse to do throughout the week because its either too hard, too long or there just isnt enough time
        throyghout the week for me to do all of the work i am supposed to. It is exhausting but it has to be done. I dont just sit down and do all
        all thw work in one sitting. I take my time and not stress myself out by doing an assignment in one sitting. I tend to start it, take a break,
        come back to it in a while and do some more, and on and on. This is done until the majority of the assignment is done.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the majority of the assignment is done there isnt much left to do. I will finish the assignment in college next chance I get. All
        that is left to do is relax and regret not going out when I see how much fun my friends are having. but on the bright side, I'd have the
        majority of my work done so I can sleep easy knowing that that piece of work id off my mind.

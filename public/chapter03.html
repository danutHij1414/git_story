    <h1>A Day in the Life: Part 3</h1>

    <p>
        At the end of the week I usually have th option of either going out with friends or stayinbg home and doing assignments or study. In the
        past i'd choose to go out all the time but lately since the college work has been increasing in difficulty and quantity of work I hhave
        to do, I now choose to stay in and do college work instead of leaving it last minute.

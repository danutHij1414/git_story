    <h1>A Day in the Life: Part 1</h1>

    <p>
        My day starts pretty much the minute the alarm goes off at half 6 everyday. At that time, i usually just sit in bed and contemplate weather
        or not I really do need my education as I don't feel like getting up that early every day. But in the end I always cave in and accept the
        fact that I have no other option.

        once up, the tedious morning routine begins. breakfast, shower, coffee, and not necessarily in that order. When all that is done, it's
        to go and get the bus which is the most frustrating time for anyone who commutes to work or college with a bus on a daily basis. The bus
        is never on time and if you're unlucky enough to miss it, which I am a lot of the time, then you have no other choice than to wait
        20 minutes or more for the next one. Usually that isn't a problem but if the weather isn't sunny or calm, then you'll have a bad time
        waiting. I have been aught many times in the rain waiting for the bus to arrive and I've forgotten my umbrella at home or the wind is too
        strong and can't use the umbrella.

        The journey to college isn't a bad one if you get the bus on time and then isn't too much traffic, which I usually achieve. But when you
        haven't had the best start to a morning then the journey can be very frustrating and tends to carry throughout the day. luckily I dont have a
        lot of those days and my only worries are assignments and deadlines and other general student worries.

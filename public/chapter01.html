    <h1>A Day in the Life: Part 1</h1>

    <p>
        My day starts pretty much the minute the alarm goes off at half 6 everyday. At that time, i usually just sit in bed and contemplate weather
        or not I really do need my education as I don't feel like getting up that early every day. But in the end I always cave in and accept the
        fact that I have no other option.

    <h1>A Day in the Life: Part 4</h1>

    <p>
        If i decided to go out instead of staying in and doing work, then the night would go very differently. I would not want to stay in and do
        assignments when my friends are out having a good time. Every now and then, I do choose to go out instead of staying in. It is a lot of fun.
        Also a lot of work. Firstly, I have to see whether my friends are going just to a pub, or to a pub and then to a nightclub or someplace else
        after we hang in the pub.

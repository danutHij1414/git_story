    <h1>A Day in the Life: Part 4</h1>

    <p>
        If i decided to go out instead of staying in and doing work, then the night would go very differently. I would not want to stay in and do
        assignments when my friends are out having a good time. Every now and then, I do choose to go out instead of staying in. It is a lot of fun.
        Also a lot of work. Firstly, I have to see whether my friends are going just to a pub, or to a pub and then to a nightclub or someplace else
        after we hang in the pub.

        Money is an issue when going out. Because I am a student, I am broke most of the time. most of my money ges into the bus and food, so finsing
        money to go out is sometiems an issue but it has never stopped me from going out. I dont always need money to have a good time. But it does
        help.

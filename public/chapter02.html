    <h1>A Day in the Life: Part 2</h1>

    <p>
        My average day in college begins almost the same way every time. Walk into the college. Buy a coffee in the canteen. Go to the smoking area
        for my morning smoke. Attend the morning lecture or lab. Or sometimes i skip the morning lecture or lab to get an assignment finished or
        started. It all depends on weather or not i think Ill have enough time to finish an assignment before the due date and time.
    </p>

    <p>
        In between all the lectures and labs I usualy have lunch with friends. We talk about all things ranging from the college work to movies
        weve seen over the weekend. When we are not having lunch or talking about things we do outside of college, we are also in the library
        doing assignments and studying.

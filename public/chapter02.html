    <h1>A Day in the Life: Part 2</h1>

    <p>
        My average day in college begins almost the same way every time. Walk into the college. Buy a coffee in the canteen. Go to the smoking area
        for my morning smoke. Attend the morning lecture or lab. Or sometimes i skip the morning lecture or lab to get an assignment finished or
        started. It all depends on weather or not i think Ill have enought time to finish an assignment before the due date and time.
